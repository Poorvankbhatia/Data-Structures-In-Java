Topological Sorting vs Depth First Traversal (DFS):
In DFS, we print a vertex and then recursively call DFS for its adjacent vertices. 
In topological sorting, we need to print a vertex before its adjacent vertices. 
For example, in the given graph, the vertex ‘5’ should be printed before vertex ‘0’, 
but unlike DFS, the vertex ‘4’ should also be printed before vertex ‘0’. 
So Topological sorting is different from DFS. 
For example, a DFS of the above graph is “5 2 3 1 0 4″, but it is not a topological sorting
