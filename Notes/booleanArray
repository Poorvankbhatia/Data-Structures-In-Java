A Boolean Array Puzzle
Input: A array arr[] of two elements having value 0 and 1

Output: Make both elements 0.

Specifications: Following are the specifications to follow.
1) It is guaranteed that one element is 0 but we do not know its position.
2) We can’t say about another element it can be 0 or 1.
3) We can only complement array elements, no other operation like and, or, multi, division, …. etc.
4) We can’t use if, else and loop constructs.
5) Obviously, we can’t directly assign 0 to array elements.



Method 1

void changeToZero(int a[2])
{
   a[ a[1] ] = a[ !a[1] ];
}

void changeToZero(int a[2])
{
    a[ !a[0] ] = a[ !a[1] ]
}
Method 3
This method doesn’t even need complement.

void changeToZero(int a[2])
{
    a[ a[1] ] = a[ a[0] ]
}


void changeToZero(int a[2])
{
  a[0] = a[a[0]];
  a[1] = a[0];
}
