DFS(analysis):

Setting/getting a vertex/edge label takes O(1) time
Each vertex is labeled twice
once as UNEXPLORED
once as VISITED
Each edge is labeled twice
once as UNEXPLORED
once as DISCOVERY or BACK
Method incidentEdges is called once for each vertex
DFS runs in O(n + m) time provided the graph is represented by the adjacency list structure
Recall that Σv deg(v) = 2m
BFS(analysis):

Setting/getting a vertex/edge label takes O(1) time
Each vertex is labeled twice
once as UNEXPLORED
once as VISITED
Each edge is labeled twice
once as UNEXPLORED
once as DISCOVERY or CROSS
Each vertex is inserted once into a sequence Li
Method incidentEdges is called once for each vertex
BFS runs in O(n + m) time provided the graph is represented by the adjacency list structure
Recall that Σv deg(v) = 2m


v1 + (incident edges) + v2 + (incident edges) + .... + vn + (incident edges)
can be rewritten as

(v1 + v2 + ... + vn) + [(incident_edges v1) + (incident_edges v2) + ... + (incident_edges vn)]
and the first group is O(N) while the other is O(E).
