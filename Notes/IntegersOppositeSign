Detect if two integers have opposite signs
Given two signed integers, write a function that returns true if the signs of given integers are different, 
otherwise false. For example, the function should return true -1 and +100, and should return false for -100 and -200. 
The function should not use any of the arithmetic operators.

Let the given integers be x and y. The sign bit is 1 in negative numbers, and 0 in positive numbers. 
The XOR of x and y will have the sign bit as 1 iff they have opposite sign. In other words, 
XOR of x and y will be negative number number iff x and y have opposite signs. The following code use this logic.

bool oppositeSigns(int x, int y)
{
    return ((x ^ y) < 0);
}
