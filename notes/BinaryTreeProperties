Binary Tree Properties:

The maximum number of nodes at level ‘l’ = 2l-1.

Maximum number of nodes = 2h – 1.
Here h is height of a tree. Height is considered
as is maximum number of nodes on root to leaf path

Minimum possible height =  ceil(Log2(n+1))

In Binary tree, number of leaf nodes is always one
more than nodes with two children.

Time Complexity of Tree Traversal: O(n)
