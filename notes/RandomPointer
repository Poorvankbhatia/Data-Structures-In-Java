Clone a linked list with next and random pointer 

You are given a Double Link List with one pointer of each node pointing to the next node just like in a single link list. 
The second pointer however CAN point to any node in the list and not just the previous node. Now write a program in O(n) time to duplicate this list. That is, write a program which will create a copy of this list.

1) Create the copy of node 1 and insert it between node 1 & node 2 in original Linked List, 
create the copy of 2 and insert it between 2 & 3.. Continue in this fashion, add the copy of N after the Nth node
2) Now copy the arbitrary link in this fashion

     original->next->arbitrary = original->arbitrary->next;  /*TRAVERSE 
TWO NODES*/
This works because original->next is nothing but copy of original and Original->arbitrary->next is nothing but copy
 of arbitrary.
3) Now restore the original and copy linked lists in this fashion in a single loop.

     original->next = original->next->next;
     copy->next = copy->next->next;
4) Make sure that last element of original->next is NULL.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
