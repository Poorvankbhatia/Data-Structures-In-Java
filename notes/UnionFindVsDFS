Union-find. How does the DFS-based solution for graph connectivity in CC compare
with the union-find
In theory, DFS is faster than union-find
because it provides a constant-time guarantee, which union-find does not; in practice,
this difference is negligible, and union-find is faster because it does not have to build
a full representation of the graph. More important, union-find is an online algorithm
(we can check whether two vertices are connected in near-constant time at any point,
even while adding edges), whereas the DFS solution must first preprocess the graph.

Therefore, for example, we prefer union-find when determining connectivity is our
only task or when we have a large number of queries intermixed with edge insertions
but may find the DFS solution more appropriate for use in a graph ADT because it
makes efficient use of existing infrastructure.
