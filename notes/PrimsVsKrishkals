Use Prim's algorithm when you have a graph with lots of edges.

For a graph with V vertices E edges, Kruskal's algorithm runs in O(E log V) time and Prim's algorithm can 
run in O(E + V log V) amortized time, if you use a Fibonacci Heap.

Prim's algorithm is significantly faster in the limit when you've got a really dense graph with many more edges than vertices. 
Kruskal performs better in typical situations (sparse graphs) because it uses simpler data structures.

The best time for Kruskal's is O(E logV). For Prim's using fib heaps we can get O(E+V lgV). 
Therefore on a dense graph, Prim's is much better.


Kruskal's algorithm will grow a solution from the cheapest edge by adding the next cheapest edge, 
provided that it doesn't create a cycle.

Prim's algorithm will grow a solution from a random vertex by adding the next cheapest vertex, the vertex that is 
not currently in the solution but connected to it by the cheapest edge.

If you implement both Kruskal and Prim, in their optimal form : with a union find and a finbonacci heap respectively, 
then you will note how Kruskal is easy to implement compared to Prim.

Prim is harder with a fibonacci heap mainly because you have to maintain a book-keeping table to record the bi-directional 
link between graph nodes and heap nodes. With a Union Find, it's the opposite, the structure is simple and can even produce
directly the mst at almost no additional cost.


Prim’s algorithm builds the MST one edge at a time, finding a new edge to attach to a single growing tree at each step.
Kruskal’s algorithm also builds the MST one edge at a time; but, by contrast, it finds an edge that connects two trees in a
forest of growing trees. We start with a degenerate forest of V single-vertex trees and perform the operation of combining
two trees (using the shortest edge possible) until there is just one tree left: the MST.
