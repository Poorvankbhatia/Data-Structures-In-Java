Efficient way to multiply with 7
We can multiply a number by 7 using bitwise operator. 
First left shift the number by 3 bits (you will get 8n) then subtract the original number
from the shifted number and return the difference (8n â€“ n).

 
int multiplyBySeven(unsigned int n)
{  
    /* Note the inner bracket here. This is needed 
       because precedence of '-' operator is higher 
       than '<<' */
    return ((n<<3) - n);
}
