Definition. A negative cycle in an edgeweighted
digraph is a directed cycle whose
total weight (sum of the weights of its
edges) is negative.

Now, suppose that some vertex on a path from s to a
reachable vertex v is also on a negative cycle. In this case,
the existence of a shortest path from s to v would be a
contradiction, because we could use the cycle to construct
a path with weight lower than any given value. In other
words, shortest paths can be an ill-posed problem if negative
cycles are present.

Proposition W. There exists a shortest path from s
to v in an edge-weighted digraph if and only if there
exists at least one directed path from s to v and no
vertex on any directed path from s to v is on a negative
cycle.
