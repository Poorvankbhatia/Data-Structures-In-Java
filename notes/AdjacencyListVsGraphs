In both DFS AND BFS, the runtime depends on how long it takes to iterate across the outgoing edges of a given node. 
With an adjacency list, the runtime is directly proportional to the number of outgoing edges. 
Since each node is visited once, the cost is the number of nodes plus the number of edges, which is O(m + n).
With am adjacency matrix, the time required to find all outgoing edges is O(n) because all n columns in the row 
for a node must be inspected. Summing up across all n nodes, this works out to O(n2).

Hope this helps!
