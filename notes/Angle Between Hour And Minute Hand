One clock cycle is 360 degree.

How many degree can the minute hand run per minute? 360 / 60 = 6 degree per minute.

How many degree can the hour hand run per hour? 360/12 = 30 degree per hour (since hour hand run slower than minute)


Since it's easier to calculate in the unit, "minute", let's get

"how many degree can the hour hand run per minute"?
30 / 60 = 0.5 degree per minute.

static double angle(int h, int m) {
    double hAngle = 0.5D * (h * 60 + m);
    double mAngle = 6 * m;
    double angle = Math.abs(hAngle - mAngle);
    angle = Math.min(angle, 360 - angle);
    return angle;
}
Basically:

The hour hand moves at the rate of 0.5 degrees per minute
The minute hand moves at the rate of of 6 degrees per minute
Problem solved.
