Turn off the rightmost set bit

Examples:

Input:  12 (00...01100)
Output: 8 (00...01000)

Input:  7 (00...00111)
Output: 6 (00...00110)
Let the input number be n. n-1 would have all the bits flipped after the 
rightmost set bit (including the set bit). So, doing n&(n-1) would give us the required result.

int fun(unsigned int n)
{
  return n&(n-1);
}
