Jolly Jumper Sequence
A sequence of n numbers (n < 3000) is called Jolly Jumper if the absolute values of the differences between the successive
elements take on all possible values from 1 through n-1. The definition implies that any sequence of a single integer is a jolly jumper.

Examples:

Input: 1 4 2 3
Output: True
This sequence 1 4 2 3 is Jolly Jumper because
the absolute differences are 3, 2, and 1.

Input: 1 4 2 -1 6
Output: False
The absolute differences are 3, 2, 3, 7.
This does not contain  all the  values from 1
through n-1. So, this sequence is not Jolly.

Input: 11 7 4 2 1 6
Output: True



The idea is to maintain a boolean array to store set of absolute difference of successive elements.
a) If absolute difference between two elements is more than n-1 or 0, return false.
b) If an absolute difference repeated, then all absolute differences from 1 to n-1 canâ€™t be present (Pigeon Hole Principle), return false.
