For any vertex v reachable from s, BFS computes a shortest path
from s to v (no path from s to v has fewer edges).

Proof: It is easy to prove by induction that the queue always consists of zero or
more vertices of distance k from the source, followed by zero or more vertices of
distance k +1 from the source, for some integer k, starting with k equal to 0. This
property implies, in particular, that vertices enter and leave the queue in order of
their distance from s. When a vertex v enters the queue, no shorter path to v will
be found before it comes off the queue, and no path to v that is discovered after it
comes off the queue can be shorter than v’s tree path length.


DFS wends its way through the graph, storing
on the stack the points where other
paths branch off; BFS sweeps through
the graph, using a queue to remember
the frontier of visited places. DFS explores
the graph by looking for new
vertices far away from the start point,
taking closer vertices only when dead
ends are encountered; BFS completely
covers the area close to the starting
point, moving farther away only when
everything nearby has been examined.
DFS paths tend to be long and winding;
BFS paths are short and direct. The algorithms differ only in the rule used to
take the next vertex from the data structure
(least recently added for BFS, most recently added for DFS).


DFS(analysis):

Setting/getting a vertex/edge label takes O(1) time
Each vertex is labeled twice
once as UNEXPLORED
once as VISITED
Each edge is labeled twice
once as UNEXPLORED
once as DISCOVERY or BACK
Method incidentEdges is called once for each vertex
DFS runs in O(n + m) time provided the graph is represented by the adjacency list structure
Recall that Σv deg(v) = 2m

v1 + (incident edges) + v2 + (incident edges) + .... + vn + (incident edges)
can be rewritten as

(v1 + v2 + ... + vn) + [(incident_edges v1) + (incident_edges v2) + ... + (incident_edges vn)]
and the first group is O(N) while the other is O(E).
