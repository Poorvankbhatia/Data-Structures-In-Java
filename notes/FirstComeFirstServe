Scheduling Algorithm : First Come First Serve (Fcfs) Java Program Code

Scheduling algorithm is used by CPU scheduler to select a process .  There are many types of scheduling algorithm but we 
will discuss about the most common  algorithm FCFS i.e. First come and First Serve .
By applying this scheduling algorithm  , the CPU makes sure that the process which is run by user are lined
in queue , just like the queue for buying tickets of movie . The person who comes first , will have the chance to
get the ticket , similarly , if  CPU is idle  and  CPU is using First come and First Serve algorithm then ,it
executes the process which arrives first .

Here , User can calculate the average turnaround time and average waiting time along with the starting and finishing time 
of each process


Turnaround time      :   Its the total time taken by the process between starting and the completion

Waiting time         :   Its the time for which process is ready to run but not executed by CPU scheduler

for example ,
we have three processes

                
                          Burst time             Waiting time         Turnaround time 


P1                          18                           0                           18 

P2                          5                             18                         23     

P3                          7                             23                         30 




So here we can see the turnaround time for the process 1 is 18 while 23 and 30 for 2nd and 3rd process

  Gantt chart for the turnaround time is

  |----------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------------|
  |                            P1                      |       P2         |             P3         |
  |----------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------------|
  0                                                    18                 23                       30

 A Gantt chart is a chart which shows the start and finish times of  all the processes .

Also first come first serve algorithm is non preemptive so if the process starts then the other 
process has to wait in the queue till the executing process finishes .

The major features of the First come first serve algorithm is that

* Throughput is low as the large process is holding up the Central processing unit for execution .
* The main disadvantage of FCFS is starving . As long as all processes completes the execution then we
   dont have any trouble, But the problem starts when any of the process fails to complete . The incomplete
   execution of any process leads to starvation .
*  Queuing is done without using any prioritization of the processes.
