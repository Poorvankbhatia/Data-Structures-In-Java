Remove duplicates from a string in O(n) without using hash.


Sort the source array. Find consecutive elements that are equal
To remove duplicates, you can copy elements from later in the array over elements earlier in the array 
also in linear time. Simply keep a pointer to the new logical end of the container, and copy the next 
distinct element to that new logical end at each step


You do a sort of bucket sort.

make an array containing every single char
make an array containing a count for it's corresponding char
The only reason we're using 2 arrays like this is because you specifically disallowed hash maps. 
You can represent this structure however you please. If you're allowed to convert chars to int, you need only use 1 array.

Since we're assuming a limited number of possible characters, Each array will be constant size, or O(1)

Iterate over your string, and increment the count for each char you find. If count is already greater than 0 
you've found a duplicate.
searching your char array for a particular char takes O(1) time, because there is a limited number of chars.

you will do this search n times for a net run-time of O(n)

If arrays are no good, than you can make a linked list to hold only values that you've found. It will still be
 constant because the size of the linked list is still bound by the number of possible characters.

If you do it that way, you'll more or less be doing the exact same thing, except it cosmetically look less like
a bucket-sort strategy.
