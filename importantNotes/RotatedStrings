A Program to check if strings are rotations of each other or not
Given a string s1 and a string s2, write a snippet to say whether s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call
to strstr routine?


(eg given s1 = ABCD and s2 = CDAB, return true, given s1 = ABCD, and s2 = ACBD , return false)


Algorithm: areRotations(str1, str2)

    1. Create a temp string and store concatenation of str1 to
       str1 in temp.
                          temp = str1.str1
    2. If str2 is a substring of temp then str1 and str2 are 
       rotations of each other.

    Example:                 
                     str1 = "ABACD"
                     str2 = "CDABA"

     temp = str1.str1 = "ABACDABACD"
     Since str2 is a substring of temp, str1 and str2 are 
     rotations of each other.
