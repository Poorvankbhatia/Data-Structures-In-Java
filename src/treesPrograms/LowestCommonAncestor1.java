/*

If we assume that the keys n1 and n2 are present in Binary Tree, we can find LCA using single traversal
 of Binary Tree and without extra storage for path arrays.
The idea is to traverse the tree starting from root. If any of the given keys (n1 and n2) matches with
 root, then root is LCA (assuming that both keys are present). If root doesnâ€™t match with any of the keys,
  we recur for left and right subtree. The node which has one key present in its left subtree and the 
  other key present in right subtree is the LCA. If both keys lie in left subtree, then left subtree has LCA also,
  otherwise LCA lies in right subtree.
