DIRECTI

There is a compressed string eg. ”ab2c3”, the string has lowercase characters and numbers.
 We can uncompress the given string as follows: whenever we get a number “n” in the string, 
 the portion of the string before the number will repeat “n” times. So in the above example,
  we get a 2, so string will become “ababc3”, now we get a 3, so final string will be “ababcababcababc”.
Given a compressed string and a number k, you have to output the k’th character in the uncompressed string.

1 <= length of string <= 1500
1 <= n <= 1000
1 <= k < 2^31
example:
input: ab2c3 10
output: c
