/*

We are given a string having parenthesis like below
     “( ((X)) (((Y))) )”
We need to find the maximum depth of balanced parenthesis, like 4 in above example.
 Since ‘Y’ is surrounded by 4 balanced parenthesis.


Stack can also be used.. the maximum value of top will be the answer

/*

Method used here without any auxiliary space O(1)

1) Take two variables max and current_max, initialize both of them as 0.
2) Traverse the string, do following for every character
    a) If current character is ‘(’, increment current_max and 
       update max value if required.
    b) If character is ‘)’. Check if current_max is positive or
       not (this condition ensure that parenthesis are balanced). 
       If positive that means we previously had a ‘(’ character 
       so decrement current_max without worry. 
       If not positive then the parenthesis are not balanced. 
       Thus return -1. 
3) If current_max is not 0, then return -1 to ensure that the parenthesis
   are balanced. Else return max
