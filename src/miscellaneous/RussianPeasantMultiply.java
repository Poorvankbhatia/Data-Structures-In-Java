/*

How does this work?
The value of a*b is same as (a*2)*(b/2) if b is even, otherwise the value is same as ((a*2)*(b/2) + a). 
In the while loop, we keep multiplying ‘a’ with 2 and keep dividing ‘b’ by 2. If ‘b’ becomes odd in loop,
 we add ‘a’ to ‘res’. When value of ‘b’ becomes 1, the value of ‘res’ + ‘a’, gives us the result.
Note that when ‘b’ is a power of 2, the ‘res’ would remain 0 and ‘a’ would have the multiplication.
