/*


Let us consider an example n = 7, k = 3. 
The first digit of 1/7 is ‘1’, it can be obtained by doing integer value of 10/7.
 Remainder of 10/7 is 3. Next digit is 4 which can be obtained by taking integer value of 30/7. 
 Remainder of 30/7 is 2. Next digits is 2 which can be obtained by taking integer value of 20/7
