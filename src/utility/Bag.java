/*

A bag is a collection where removing items is not supportedâ€”its purpose is to
provide clients with the ability to collect items and then to iterate through the collected
items (the client can also test if a bag is empty and find its number of items). The order
of iteration is unspecified and should be immaterial to the client. To appreciate the concept,
consider the idea of an avid marble collector, who might put marbles in a bag, one
at a time, and periodically process all the marbles to look
for one having some particular characteristic. With our
Bag API, a client can add items to a bag and process them
all with a foreach statement whenever needed. Such a client
could use a stack or a queue, but one way to emphasize
that the order in which items are processed is immaterial
is to use a Bag.
