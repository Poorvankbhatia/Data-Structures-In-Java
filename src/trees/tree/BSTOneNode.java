Check if each internal node of a BST has exactly one child
Given Preorder traversal of a BST, check if each non-leaf node has only one child. 
Assume that the BST contains unique entries.

Examples

Input: pre[] = {20, 10, 11, 13, 12}
Output: Yes
The give array represents following BST. In the following BST, every internal
node has exactly 1 child. Therefor, the output is true.
        20
       /
      10
       \
        11
          \
           13
           /
         12

/*

Since all the descendants of a node must either be larger or smaller than the node. We can do following for every node in a loop.
1. Find the next preorder successor (or descendant) of the node.
2. Find the last preorder successor (last element in pre[]) of the node.
3. If both successors are less than the current node, or both successors are greater than the current node, then continue.
 Else, return false.
