 The order of nodes in DLL must be same as Inorder of the given Binary Tree. The first node of Inorder traversal (left most node in BT) must be head node of the DLL.

/*

The idea is to do inorder traversal of the binary tree. 
While doing inorder traversal, keep track of the previously visited node 
in a variable say prev. For every visited node, make it next of prev and previous of this node as prev.

The above program does a simple inorder traversal, so time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of nodes in given binary tree.
