How to check if a given array represents a Binary Heap?
Given an array, how to check if the given array represents a Binary Max-Heap.

Examples:

Input:  arr[] = {90, 15, 10, 7, 12, 2}
Output: True
The given array represents below tree
       90
     /    \
   15      10
  /  \     /
 7    12  2
The tree follows max-heap property as every
node is greater than all of its descendants.

Input:  arr[] = {9, 15, 10, 7, 12, 11}
Output: False
The given array represents below tree
       9
     /    \
   15      10
  /  \     /
 7    12  11
The tree doesn't follows max-heap property 9 is
smaller than 15 and 10, and 10 is smaller than 11.
