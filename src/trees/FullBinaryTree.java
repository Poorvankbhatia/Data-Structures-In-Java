/*

Check whether a binary tree is a full binary tree or not
A full binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which all nodes have either zero or two child nodes. 
Conversely, there is no node in a full binary tree, which has one child node.

/*

To check whether a binary tree is a full binary tree we need to test the following cases:-

1) If a binary tree node is NULL then it is a full binary tree.
2) If a binary tree node does have empty left and right sub-trees, then it is a full binary tree by definition
3) If a binary tree node has left and right sub-trees, then it is a part of a full binary tree by definition. 
In this case recursively check if the left and right sub-trees are also binary trees themselves.
4) In all other combinations of right and left sub-trees, the binary tree is not a full binary tree.
