/*

We can find the maximum sum using single traversal of binary tree. 
The idea is to maintain two values in recursive calls
1) Maximum root to leaf path sum for the subtree rooted under current node.
2) The maximum path sum between leaves (desired output).

For every visited node X, we find the maximum root to leaf sum in left and right 
subtrees of X. We add the two values with X->data, and compare the sum with maximum path sum found so far.
