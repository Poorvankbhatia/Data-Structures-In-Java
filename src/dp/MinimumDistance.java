/*

The idea in below code is to first calculate min cost for station 1, 
then for station 2, and so on. These costs are stored in an array dist[0...N-1].

1) The min cost for station 0 is 0, i.e., dist[0] = 0

2) The min cost for station 1 is cost[0][1], i.e., dist[1] = cost[0][1]

3) The min cost for station 2 is minimum of following two.
     a) dist[0] + cost[0][2]
     b) dist[1] + cost[1][2]

3) The min cost for station 3 is minimum of following three.
     a) dist[0] + cost[0][3]
     b) dist[1] + cost[1][3]
     c) dist[2] + cost[2][3]

Similarly, dist[4], dist[5], ... dist[N-1] are calculated.


The minimum cost to reach N-1 from 0 can be recursively written as following:

minCost(0, N-1) = MIN { cost[0][n-1],
                        cost[0][1] + minCost(1, N-1),
                        minCost(0, 2) + minCost(2, N-1),
                        ........,
                        minCost(0, N-2) + cost[N-2][n-1] }
