/*

There are N stations on route of a train. The train goes from station 0 to N-1.
The ticket cost for all pair of stations (i, j) is given where j is greater than i. 
Find the minimum cost to reach the destination.

Consider the following example:

Input: 
cost[N][N] = { {0, 15, 80, 90},
              {INF, 0, 40, 50},
              {INF, INF, 0, 70},
              {INF, INF, INF, 0}
             };
There are 4 stations and cost[i][j] indicates cost to reach j 
from i. The entries where j < i are meaningless.

Output:
The minimum cost is 65
The minimum cost can be obtained by first going to station 1 
from 0. Then from station 1 to station 3.

/*

The idea in below code is to first calculate min cost for station 1, then for station 2, and so on. 
These costs are stored in an array dist[0...N-1].

1) The min cost for station 0 is 0, i.e., dist[0] = 0

2) The min cost for station 1 is cost[0][1], i.e., dist[1] = cost[0][1]

3) The min cost for station 2 is minimum of following two.
     a) dist[0] + cost[0][2]
     b) dist[1] + cost[1][2]

3) The min cost for station 3 is minimum of following three.
     a) dist[0] + cost[0][3]
     b) dist[1] + cost[1][3]
     c) dist[2] + cost[2][3]

Similarly, dist[4], dist[5], ... dist[N-1] are calculated.


minCost(0, N-1) = MIN { cost[0][n-1],
                        cost[0][1] + minCost(1, N-1),
                        minCost(0, 2) + minCost(2, N-1),
                        ........,
                        minCost(0, N-2) + cost[N-2][n-1] }
