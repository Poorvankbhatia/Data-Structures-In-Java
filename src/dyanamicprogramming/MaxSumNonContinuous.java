/*

Maximum sum such that no two elements are adjacent
Question: Given an array of positive numbers, find the maximum sum of a subsequence with
 the constraint that no 2 numbers in the sequence should be adjacent in the array. So 3 2 7 10 
 should return 13 (sum of 3 and 10) or 3 2 5 10 7 should return 15 (sum of 3, 5 and 7).

        Loop for all elements in arr[] and maintain two sums incl and excl where incl = Max sum including the 
        previous element and excl = Max sum excluding the previous element.
        Max sum excluding the current element will be max(incl, excl) and max sum including the current 
        element will be excl + current element (Note that only excl is considered because elements cannot be adjacent).
        At the end of the loop return max of incl and excl.

          excl = max(5, 15) = 65

          And 35 is the last element. So, answer is max(incl, excl) =  80
