Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge uv,
 vertex u comes before v in the ordering. Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.

/*

In topological sorting, we use a temporary stack. We donâ€™t print the vertex immediately, we first recursively call
 topological sorting for all its adjacent vertices, then push it to a stack.
  Finally, print contents of stack. Note that a vertex is pushed to stack only 
  when all of its adjacent vertices (and their adjacent vertices and so on) are already in stack.
