DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING SOLUTION EXISTS

Count all possible walks from a source to a destination with exactly k edges
Given a directed graph and two vertices ‘u’ and ‘v’ in it, count all possible walks from ‘u’ to ‘v’
 with exactly k edges on the walk.

The graph is given as adjacency matrix representation where value of graph[i][j] as 1 
indicates that there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j and a value 0 indicates no edge from i to j.

/*

A simple solution is to start from u, go to all adjacent vertices and recur for adjacent vertices with k as k-1,
 source as adjacent vertex and destination as v. 
 
 The worst case time complexity of the above function is O(Vk) where V is the number of vertices 
 in the given graph. We can simply analyze the time complexity by drawing recursion tree. 
 The worst occurs for a complete graph. In worst case, every internal node of recursion tree would have exactly n children.
