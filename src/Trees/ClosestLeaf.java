/*

Given a Binary Tree and a key ‘k’, find distance of the closest leaf from ‘k’.

Examples:

              A
            /    \
           B       C
                 /   \
                E     F
               /       \
              G         H
             / \       /
            I   J     K

Closest leaf to 'H' is 'K', so distance is 1 for 'H'
Closest leaf to 'C' is 'B', so distance is 2 for 'C'
Closest leaf to 'E' is either 'I' or 'J', so distance is 2 for 'E'
Closest leaf to 'B' is 'B' itself, so distance is 0 for 'B'

/*

The main point to note here is that a closest key can either be a descendent of given
 key or can be reached through one of the ancestors.
The idea is to traverse the given tree in preorder and keep track of ancestors in an array. 
When we reach the given key, we evaluate distance of the closest leaf in subtree rooted with given key. 
We also traverse all ancestors one by one and find distance of the closest leaf in the subtree rooted with ancestor.
We compare all distances and return minimum.
