/*

The problem can also be solved using simple recursive traversal. 
We can keep track of level of a node by passing a parameter to all recursive calls. 
The idea is to keep track of maximum level also. Whenever we see a node whose level 
is more than maximum level so far, we print the node because this is the first node in its level
