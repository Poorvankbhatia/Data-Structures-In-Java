What is the longest substring that appears at least
twice in a given string? For example, the longest repeated substring in the string
"to be or not to be" is the string "to be".

/*

brute-force solution immediately suggests itself: we compare the substring starting at
each string position i with the substring starting at each other starting position j, keeping
track of the longest match found. This code is not useful for long strings, because
its running time is at least quadratic in the length of the string: as usual, the number of
different pairs i and j is N (N1)
 2, so the number of calls on lcp() for this approach
would be ~N^2/2. Using this solution for a genomic sequence with millions of characters
would require trillions of lcp() calls, which is infeasible.


The key to the algorithm is that every
substring appears somewhere as a prefix of
one of the suffixes in the array. After sorting, the
longest repeated substrings will appear in adjacent
positions in the array. Thus, we can make
a single pass through the sorted array, keeping
track of the longest matching prefixes between
adjacent strings



Worst input in case when LRS is very long:

Same letter is repeated N times,So there are 2 copies.

twinstwins
winstwins
instwins
nstwins
stwins
twins
wins
ins
ns
s

D = Longest Match
LRS needs = 1+2+3+4..D = Quadratic!!!
