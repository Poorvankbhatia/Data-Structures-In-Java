/*
Worst case time complexity of Jarvis’s Algorithm is O(n^2). Using Graham’s scan algorithm, we can find Convex Hull in O(nLogn) time.
Following is Graham’s algorithm

Let points[0..n-1] be the input array.

1) Find the bottom-most point by comparing y coordinate of all points. If there are two points with same y value,
then the point with smaller x coordinate value is considered. Let the bottom-most point be P0. Put P0 at first position in output hull.

2) Consider the remaining n-1 points and sort them by polor angle in counterclockwise order around points[0].
If polor angle of two points is same, then put the nearest point first.

3 After sorting, check if two or more points have same angle. If two more points have same angle, then remove
 all same angle points except the point farthest from P0. Let the size of new array be m.

4) If m is less than 3, return (Convex Hull not possible)

5) Create an empty stack ‘S’ and push points[0], points[1] and points[2] to S.

6) Process remaining m-3 points one by one. Do following for every point ‘points[i]’
        4.1) Keep removing points from stack while orientation of following 3 points is not counterclockwise (or they don’t make a left turn).
            a) Point next to top in stack
            b) Point at the top of stack
            c) points[i]
         4.2) Push points[i] to S

5) Print contents of S


Let n be the number of input points. The algorithm takes O(nLogn) time if we use a O(nLogn) sorting algorithm.
The first step (finding the bottom-most point) takes O(n) time. The second step (sorting points) takes O(nLogn) time.
Third step takes O(n) time. In third step, every element is pushed and popped at most one time. So the sixth step to
process points one by one takes O(n) time, assuming that the stack operations take O(1) time. Overall complexity is
 O(n) + O(nLogn) + O(n) + O(n) which is O(nLogn)
