Find a triplet that sum to a given value
Given an array and a value, find if there is a triplet in array whose sum is equal to the given value. 
If there is such a triplet present in array, then print the triplet and return true. Else return false. 
For example, if the given array is {12, 3, 4, 1, 6, 9} and given sum is 24, then there is a triplet (12, 3 and 9) 
present in array whose sum is 24

/*

Time complexity of the method 1 is O(n^3). The complexity can be reduced to O(n^2) by sorting the array first,
 and then using method 1 of this post in a loop.
1) Sort the input array.
2) Fix the first element as A[i] where i is from 0 to array size â€“ 2. 
After fixing the first element of triplet, find the other two elements using method 1 of this post.
