/*

Sum of two bits can be obtained by performing XOR (^) of the two bits. Carry bit can be obtained by performing 
AND (&) of two bits.
Above is simple Half Adder logic that can be used to add 2 single bits. We can extend this logic for integers. 
If x and y donâ€™t have set bits at same position(s), then bitwise XOR (^) of x and y gives the sum of x and y.
 To incorporate common set bits also, bitwise AND (&) is used. Bitwise AND of x and y gives all carry bits.
  We calculate (x & y) << 1 and add it to x ^ y to get the required result.
