/*

Parity: Parity of a number refers to whether it contains an odd or even number of 1-bits. 
The number has “odd parity”, if it contains odd number of 1-bits and is “even parity” if it contains even number of 1-bits.
Main idea of the below solution is – Loop while n is not 0 and in loop unset one of the set bits and invert parity.

Time Complexity: The time taken by above algorithm is proportional to the number of bits set. 
Worst case complexity is O(Logn).

Uses: Parity is used in error detection and cryptography.
