/*

LCS Problem Statement: Given two sequences, find the length of longest 
subsequence present in both of them. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, 
but not necessarily contiguous. For example, “abc”, “abg”, “bdf”, “aeg”, ‘”acefg”, .. etc are subsequences of 
“abcdefg”. So a string of length n has 2^n different possible subsequences.

It is a classic computer science problem, 
the basis of diff (a file comparison program that outputs the differences between two files), 
and has applications in bioinformatics.

Examples:
LCS for input Sequences “ABCDGH” and “AEDFHR” is “ADH” of length 3.
LCS for input Sequences “AGGTAB” and “GXTXAYB” is “GTAB” of length 4.

/*

Let the input sequences be X[0..m-1] and Y[0..n-1] of lengths m and n respectively. 
And let L(X[0..m-1], Y[0..n-1]) be the length of LCS of the two sequences X and Y. 
Following is the recursive definition of L(X[0..m-1], Y[0..n-1]).

If last characters of both sequences match (or X[m-1] == Y[n-1]) then
L(X[0..m-1], Y[0..n-1]) = 1 + L(X[0..m-2], Y[0..n-2])

If last characters of both sequences do not match (or X[m-1] != Y[n-1]) then
L(X[0..m-1], Y[0..n-1]) = MAX ( L(X[0..m-2], Y[0..n-1]), L(X[0..m-1], Y[0..n-2])

Examples:
1) Consider the input strings “AGGTAB” and “GXTXAYB”. Last characters match for the strings. 
So length of LCS can be written as:
L(“AGGTAB”, “GXTXAYB”) = 1 + L(“AGGTA”, “GXTXAY”)

2) Consider the input strings “ABCDGH” and “AEDFHR. Last characters do not match for the strings. 
So length of LCS can be written as:
L(“ABCDGH”, “AEDFHR”) = MAX ( L(“ABCDG”, “AEDFHR”), L(“ABCDGH”, “AEDFH”) )

So the LCS problem has optimal substructure property as the main problem can be solved using solutions to subproblems.
