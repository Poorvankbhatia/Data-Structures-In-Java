/**
 * we schedule the jobs in topological
 * order and the total time required is the total duration of the jobs. Now, we
 * assume that we have sufficient processors to perform as many jobs as possible, limited
 * only by precedence constraints. Again, thousands or even millions of jobs might be
 * involved, so we require an efficient algorithm. Remarkably, a lineartime
 * algorithm is available—an approach known as the critical pathmethod demonstrates
 * that the problem is equivalent to a longestpaths
 * problem in an edge-weighted DAG.
 *
 * Definition. The critical path method for parallel scheduling is to proceed as follows:
 * Create an edge-weighted DAG with a source s, a sink t, and two vertices for each
 * job (a start vertex and an end vertex). For each job, add an edge from its start vertex
 * to its end vertex with weight equal to its duration. For each precedence constraint
 * v->w, add a zero-weight edge from the end vertex corresponding to v's to the beginning
 * vertex corresponding to w. Also add zero-weight edges from the source to each
 * job’s start vertex and from each job’s end vertex to the sink. Now, schedule each job
 * at the time given by the length of its longest path from the source.
 *
 * SEE IMAGES
 *
 * The class CPM is a straightforward implementation
 * of the critical path method. It transforms any instance of the job-scheduling
 * problem into an instance of the longest-paths problem in an edge-weighted DAG, uses
 * AcyclicLP to solve it, then prints the job start times and schedule finish time.
 *
 *
 * The critical path method solves the parallel precedence constrained
 * scheduling problem in linear time.
 * Proof: Why does the CPM approach work? The correctness of the algorithm
 * rests on two facts. First, every path in the DAG is a sequence of job
 * starts and job finishes, separated by zero-weight precedence constraints—
 * the length of any path from the source s to any vertex v in the graph is a
 * lower bound on the start/finish time represented by v, because we could
 * not do better than scheduling those jobs one after another on the same machine.
 * In particular, the length of the longest path from s to the sink t is a
 * lower bound on the finish time of all the jobs.
 * Second, all the start and finish
 * times implied by longest paths are feasible—every job starts after the finish
 * of all the jobs where it appears as a successor in a precedence constraint,
 * because the start time is the length of the longest path from the source to it.
 * In particular, the length of the longest path from s to t is an upper bound
 * on the finish time of all the jobs.
