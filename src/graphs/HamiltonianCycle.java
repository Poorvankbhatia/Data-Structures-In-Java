/*

Hamiltonian Path in an undirected graph is a path that visits each vertex exactly once. 
A Hamiltonian cycle (or Hamiltonian circuit) is a Hamiltonian Path such that there is an edge (in graph) 
from the last vertex to the first vertex of the Hamiltonian Path. Determine whether a given graph contains 
Hamiltonian Cycle or not. If it contains, then print the path. Following are the input and output of the required function.

Input:
A 2D array graph[V][V] where V is the number of vertices in graph and graph[V][V] is adjacency matrix representation 
of the graph. A value graph[i][j] is 1 if there is a direct edge from i to j, otherwise graph[i][j] is 0.

Output:
An array path[V] that should contain the Hamiltonian Path. path[i] should represent the ith vertex in the Hamiltonian Path. 
The code should also return false if there is no Hamiltonian Cycle in the graph.

For example, a Hamiltonian Cycle in the following graph is {0, 1, 2, 4, 3, 0}. There are more Hamiltonian Cycles in the graph 
like {0, 3, 4, 2, 1, 0}

(0)--(1)--(2)
 |   / \   |
 |  /   \  | 
 | /     \ |
(3)-------(4)
And the following graph doesnâ€™t contain any Hamiltonian Cycle.

(0)--(1)--(2)
 |   / \   |
 |  /   \  | 
 | /     \ |
(3)      (4)

Backtracking Algorithm
Create an empty path array and add vertex 0 to it. Add other vertices, starting from the vertex 1. Before adding a vertex,
 check for whether it is adjacent to the previously added vertex and not already added. If we find such a vertex, we add the 
 vertex as part of the solution. If we do not find a vertex then we return false.
