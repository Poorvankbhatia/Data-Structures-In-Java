Bridges in a graph
An edge in an undirected connected graph is a bridge iff removing it disconnects the graph. 
For a disconnected undirected graph, definition is similar, a bridge is an edge removing which increases number of connected components.
Like Articulation Points,bridges represent vulnerabilities in a connected network and are useful for designing reliable networks. 
For example, in a wired computer network, an articulation point indicates the critical computers and a bridge indicates the
critical wires or connections.


A O(V+E) algorithm to find all Bridges
The idea is similar to O(V+E) algorithm for Articulation Points. We do DFS traversal of the given graph. In DFS tree an edge 
(u, v) (u is parent of v in DFS tree) is bridge 
if there does not exit any other alternative to reach u or an ancestor of u from subtree rooted with v. As discussed in the 
previous post, the value low[v] indicates earliest visited vertex reachable from subtree rooted with v. 
The condition for an edge (u, v) to be a bridge is, “low[v] > disc[u]”.

Time Complexity: The above function is simple DFS with additional arrays.
So time complexity is same as DFS which is O(V+E) for adjacency list representation of graph.
