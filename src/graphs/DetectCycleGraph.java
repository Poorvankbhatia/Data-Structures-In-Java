Detect Cycle in a Directed Graph
Given a directed graph, check whether the graph contains a cycle or not. Your function should return true if the given graph
 contains at least one cycle, else return false. For example, the following graph contains three cycles 0->2->0, 0->1->2->0 and
 3->3, so your function must return true.


Solution
Depth First Traversal can be used to detect cycle in a Graph. DFS for a connected graph produces a tree. 
There is a cycle in a graph only if there is a back edge present in the graph. A back edge is an edge that is from a node 
to itself (selfloop) or one of its ancestor in the tree produced by DFS. In the following graph, there are 3 back edges, 
marked with cross sign. We can observe that these 3 back edges indicate 3 cycles present in the graph.


For a disconnected graph, we get the DFS forrest as output. To detect cycle, we can check for cycle in individual trees 
by checking back edges.

To detect a back edge, we can keep track of vertices currently in recursion stack of function for DFS traversal. 
If we reach a vertexToConsider that is already in the recursion stack, then there is a cycle in the tree. The edge that connects
current vertexToConsider to the vertexToConsider in the recursion stack is back edge. We have used recStack[] array to keep track of vertices
in the recursion stack.
