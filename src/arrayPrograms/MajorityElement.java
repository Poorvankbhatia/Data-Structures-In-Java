Using Moore’s Voting Algorithm)

This is a two step process.
1. Get an element occurring most of the time in the array. This phase will make sure 
that if there is a majority element then it will return that only.
2. Check if the element obtained from above step is majority element.

1. Finding a Candidate:
The algorithm for first phase that works in O(n) is known as Moore’s Voting Algorithm. Basic idea of the algorithm
 is if we cancel out each occurrence of an element e with all the other elements that are different from e then e
  will exist till end if it is a majority element.

findCandidate(a[], size)
1.  Initialize index and count of majority element
     maj_index = 0, count = 1
2.  Loop for i = 1 to size – 1
    (a)If a[maj_index] == a[i]
        count++
    (b)Else
        count--;
    (c)If count == 0
        maj_index = i;
        count = 1
3.  Return a[maj_index]
Above algorithm loops through each element and maintains a count of a[maj_index], 
If next element is same then increments the count, if next element is not same then 
decrements the count, and if the count reaches 0 then changes the maj_index to the current element and sets count to 1.
First Phase algorithm gives us a candidate element. In second phase we need to check 
if the candidate is really a majority element. Second phase is simple and can be easily done in O(n). We just need to check
 if count of the candidate element is greater than n/2.

Example:
A[] = 2, 2, 3, 5, 2, 2, 6
Initialize:
maj_index = 0, count = 1 –> candidate ‘2?
2, 2, 3, 5, 2, 2, 6

Same as a[maj_index] => count = 2
2, 2, 3, 5, 2, 2, 6

Different from a[maj_index] => count = 1
2, 2, 3, 5, 2, 2, 6

Different from a[maj_index] => count = 0
Since count = 0, change candidate for majority element to 5 => maj_index = 3, count = 1
2, 2, 3, 5, 2, 2, 6

Different from a[maj_index] => count = 0
Since count = 0, change candidate for majority element to 2 => maj_index = 4
2, 2, 3, 5, 2, 2, 6

Same as a[maj_index] => count = 2
2, 2, 3, 5, 2, 2, 6

Different from a[maj_index] => count = 1

Finally candidate for majority element is 2.

First step uses Moore’s Voting Algorithm to get a candidate for majority element.

2. Check if the element obtained in step 1 is majority

printMajority (a[], size)
1.  Find the candidate for majority
2.  If candidate is majority. i.e., appears more than n/2 times.
       Print the candidate
3.  Else
       Print "NONE"
