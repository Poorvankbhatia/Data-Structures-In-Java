Let the given array be arr[]. A simple solution is to create an auxiliary array temp[] which is initially a 
copy of arr[]. Randomly select an element from temp[], copy the randomly selected element to arr[0] and 
remove the selected element from temp[]. Repeat the same process n times and keep copying elements to 
arr[1], arr[2], … . The time complexity of this solution will be O(n^2).

Fisher–Yates shuffle Algorithm works in O(n) time complexity. The assumption here is, we are given a 
function rand() that generates random number in O(1) time.
The idea is to start from the last element, swap it with a randomly selected element from the whole 
array (including last). Now consider the array from 0 to n-2 (size reduced by 1), 
and repeat the process till we hit the first element.

Following is the detailed algorithm

To shuffle an array a of n elements (indices 0..n-1):
  for i from n - 1 downto 1 do
       j = random integer with 0 <= j <= i
       exchange a[j] and a[i]


How does this work?
The probability that ith element (including the last one) goes to last position is 1/n, 
because we randomly pick an element in first iteration.

The probability that ith element goes to second last position can be proved to be 1/n by dividing it in two cases.
Case 1: i = n-1 (index of last element):
The probability of last element going to second last position is = (probability that last 
element doesn't stay at its original position) x (probability that the index picked in previous 
step is picked again so that the last element is swapped)

So the probability = ((n-1)/n) x (1/(n-1)) = 1/n
Case 2: 0 < i < n-1 (index of non-last):
The probability of ith element going to second position = (probability that ith element is not picked in previous 
iteration) x (probability that ith element is picked in this iteration)
So the probability = ((n-1)/n) x (1/(n-1)) = 1/n
